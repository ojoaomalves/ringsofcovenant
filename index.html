            <p><strong>9th of Duskfall, Year of Covenant 181</strong></p>
            <p>The Day of Covenant has come again. The village gathers in the square, repeating the Ritual as they have for 181 years. The elders carve runes into the earth, the torches burn low, and the offering is made. We tell ourselves the Mists will not come where the Ritual holds. We must believe it.</p>
            <p>But I have seen the Mists at the boundary, writhing as if alive, inching forward only to recoil. I have heard whispers on the wind, voices speaking words I do not understand. How much longer will the Ritual keep them at bay? How much longer before the price is not enough?</p>
            <p><em>May the Dames keep us.</em></p>
            <p>— Elias Thorn</p>
